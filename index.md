I am the Canada Research Chair in Spatiotemporal Modelling and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto. My research interests include
- Spatial and spatiotemporal models with computationally efficient Gaussian random fields (Gaussian processes),
- Methods for building and assessing Bayesian models, including prior specification, model criticism, and model checking.
- Computational statistics, including approximate inference methods (such as INLA), Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and methods for assessing the quality of approximations to posterior distributions.
- Applications of statistics in environmental science (specifically modelling air quality) and global health (specifically modelling global maternal cause of death on a global scale).


I have made major contributions to the understanding of computationally efficient methods in spatial statistics, and of how to specify prior distributions for complex Bayesian models. I have been a maintainer and developer on both the [R-INLA](http://r-inla.org/) and [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) projects, which are widely used open source software projects popular in the applied statistics and scientific communities. I have also been a member of Stan’s leadership bodies, first the NumFOCUS board and then the Stan Governing Board that grew out from it.


Since 2011, I have given 38 seminars at leading universities across the UK, Europe, Australia, and North America.  I have delivered 29 short courses (between 1 and 4 days) on Bayesian statistics, spatial statistics, statistical ecology, spatial epidemiology, inverse problems, and data science. The audiences of these courses have varied from to academic statisticians to applied statisticians to ecologist, and to industrial statisticians.  Additionally, I have given 22 invited presentations at conferences and workshops around the world.

Prior to my commencement at the University of Toronto, I was a Reader (Associate Professor) at the University of Bath in the UK. I held postdoctoral positions at the  University of Warwick (CRiSM Fellow), the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), University of Helsinki, and Umeå University.
